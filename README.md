# Task 4: Binary Classification with Logistic Regression

## Objective
[cite_start]The goal of this task was to build and evaluate a **binary classifier** using the **Logistic Regression** algorithm, a core concept in machine learning for classification problems. [cite: 3, 4] [cite_start]This exercise helps in understanding key machine learning steps like feature standardization, model training, and evaluation using various metrics. [cite: 16]

## Dataset
* [cite_start]**Dataset Used:** Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset. [cite: 14]
* [cite_start]**Source:** The dataset is conveniently available through the `sklearn.datasets` module, or it can be downloaded. [cite: 14, 15]
* **Relevance:** This is a classic binary classification problem where the model must predict whether a tumor is **Malignant** (1) or **Benign** (0) based on various features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNAs).

## Tools and Libraries
[cite_start]The following Python libraries were used: [cite: 4]
* **`scikit-learn` (sklearn):** For model implementation (`LogisticRegression`), data splitting (`train_test_split`), feature standardization (`StandardScaler`), and evaluation metrics (`confusion_matrix`, `roc_auc_score`, `precision_score`, `recall_score`, `RocCurveDisplay`).
* **`Pandas`:** Although not strictly required for the built-in sklearn dataset, it's generally used for data manipulation and preparation.
* **`Matplotlib`:** For visualizing results, specifically the ROC curve.

## Implementation Steps (Mini Guide Followed)
1.  [cite_start]**Dataset Selection:** Used the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset**, which is suitable for binary classification. [cite: 8, 14]
2.  [cite_start]**Train/Test Split & Standardization:** [cite: 9]
    * The data was split into training and testing sets (e.g., 70% train, 30% test).
    * **Feature Standardization** was applied to the features using `StandardScaler` to ensure all features contribute equally to the model training, which is crucial for algorithms like Logistic Regression that use distance measures.
3.  [cite_start]**Model Fitting:** A `LogisticRegression` model was initialized and trained (`fit`) on the standardized training data. [cite: 10]
4.  [cite_start]**Model Evaluation:** [cite: 11]
    * Predictions were made on the test set.
    * Key metrics were calculated:
        * **Confusion Matrix**
        * **Precision** and **Recall**
        * **ROC-AUC Score** (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve)
5.  [cite_start]**Sigmoid Function Explanation:** The report/code includes an explanation of the sigmoid function, which is central to Logistic Regression. [cite: 12]
6.  [cite_start]**Threshold Tuning (Demonstration):** The process shows how the classification threshold (default is 0.5) can be adjusted to potentially optimize precision or recall based on the specific problem requirements. [cite: 12]

## Results and Metrics
*(In your final submission, you would paste the actual output/screenshots of the metrics and the ROC curve here.)*

| Metric | Value (Example) | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Accuracy** | 0.98 | Overall correctness of the model. |
| **Precision** | 0.97 | The proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct. |
| **Recall** | 0.98 | The proportion of actual positives that were identified correctly. |
| **ROC-AUC Score** | 0.99 | A measure of the model's ability to distinguish between classes. (Closer to 1 is better). |
